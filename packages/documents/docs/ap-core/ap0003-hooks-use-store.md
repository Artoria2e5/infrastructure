# AP0003: Store Hooks

A store hook stores a piece of information, it works like `useState` in React,
and the design concept comes from [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

## How to use it

We need to define a store before using it:

```ts
import { AtomDefinition } from '@recative/ap-core'

const COUNT_STORE = AtomDefinition<number>(0)
```

In Recative AP, the variables used to define Atom are usually SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE,
the name of the variable should end with `_STORE`, JUST SHOUT IT OUT!

You can consume it with the `useStore` hook, it will return three methods:
* **getter**: You can get value from the store with this method;
* **setter**: You can replace the value in the store with this method;
* **subscriber**: You can subscribe the value update with this method.

Here's an example:

```ts
const [getCount, setCount, subscribeCountUpdate] = useStore(COUNT_STORE)

getCount() // it will return 0
setCount(1) // The value will be update to 1
subscribeCountUpdate((x) => {
    // Each time the value changes, this function will be called, `x` is the 
    // value updated to.
})
```

## Pitfall

Do NOT Do set the store value in a high frequency, as this can cause performance
issue, if you need to update a value to update the parameter of a specific visual
objects, use stylesheet instead.

## Some implementation details

The logic behind `useStore` is handled by [`AtomStore`](modules#atomstore), this
is why there's something called `AtomDefinition`, when the Recative AP app initialized,
values in AtomDefinition will be copied to `AtomStore`, when the app is killed, 
the values that have been stored are automatically cleaned up by Recative AP and 
user's browser.
