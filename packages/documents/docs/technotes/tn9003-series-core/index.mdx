# TN9003: Series Core - Series Level Content Management

## Introduction

`SeriesCore` is a crucial component of the Recative System that handles
scheduling tasks related to switching between different program Episodes. Its
primary role is to manage the transactional work of destroying old Episodes and
enabling new Episodes to start playing. Developers can use the SeriesCore APIs
to control the behavior of the scheduler, such as preventing auto-play from
occurring.

## Switching between episodes

The core logic of `SeriesCore` is encapsulated in the setEpisode function. When
developers call this function, it takes care of scheduling the new Episode to
start playing and destroys the data associated with the old Episode at an
appropriate time.

When the setEpisode function is called, `SeriesCore` first checks to see if
there is a currently playing episode. If there is, it will stop playback of that
episode and destroy any associated data that is no longer needed. Then, it will
load the new episode into memory and prepare it for playback.

At this point, developers can use a number of optional arguments to customize
the behavior of the scheduler. For example, they can specify whether or not auto
play should be enabled for the new episode with `shouldBlockEpisodePlay`, should
wait for the event to destroy the old episode core with
`shouldBlockEpisodeDestroy`.

Once all of the necessary preparations have been made, `SeriesCore` will begin
playback of the new episode. It will also update its internal state to reflect
the fact that a new episode is now playing, so that it can correctly handle any
subsequent switching tasks.

## Events

Series core may dispatch several events for different purposes:

| Name           | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `segmentStart` | This event is emitted when an asset (segment) starts playing.       |
| `segmentEnd`   | This event is emitted when an asset (segment) segment ends playing. |
| `end`          | This event is emitted when the episode core is destroyed.           |
| `initialized`  | This event is emitted when the episode core is initialized.         |

## Stores

Data which is shared among all episodes are managed by the SeriesCore, which
includes:

| Name                      | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `envVariable`             | The client related environment variables like device type and browser engine. |
| `userData`                | The user related data like token, avatar and name.                            |
| `userImplementedFunction` | Platform specific functions like payment and persistence data store.          |
