# TN9001: Project Model

## Abstract

To help developers and content creators manage their applications properly, we
built a three-level model. This model can ease the mental burden of maintaining
your resources, creating enough flexibility for the different deploying targets.

Developers can choose technology stacks at different levels of complexity to
solve different tasks. In this article, we will give a brief introduction to
this three-level model.

## Introduction

Web Media Foundation manages its content with a three-level model:

<ThreeLevelModel
  style={{
    maxWidth: '184px',
    padding: '0 16px',
    float: 'right',
  }}
  alt="The three-level model of the Web Media Foundation"
/>

- **<span id="asset">Asset</span>:** Asset is the minimum unit of independent
  content, it could be a piece of video, or a small piece of web application
  based on PIXI.js. You can expect there would be more possible options in the
  future.

- **Episode:** Episode is the minimum unit of data loading, resource
  management, and lifecycle management. while an episode is initializing, we will
  try to download an asset definition list and preload all resources if the
  resource definition is required. If your environment implemented a cache method,
  the episode manager will also try to download the resource to the local hard disk,
  which will boost the initialize speed for further visits.

- **Series:** If your content is too complex to be handled in one single episode,
  you can split your assets into different episodes, and add all episodes into
  one single series. The series manager will manage the lifecycle of every single
  episode. Since loading a new episode needs fetching additional data,
  performance may be compromised, please make a good trade-off between high RAM
  usage and extended load times.

For the different levels of abstraction, we have different packages to take care of
lifecycles, RAM consumption, and performance issue.

<ThreeLevelPackage
  style={{
    maxWidth: '184px',
    padding: '0 16px',
    float: 'right',
  }}
  alt="Four level of packages for the three-level model"
/>

- **`ap-core`:** `@web-media/ap-core` is a set of toolkits for building
  simple interactive content, we implemented multiple scheduling mechanisms to help
  developers building a web application without performance issues. Currently,
  there's official support for [PIXI.js](https://pixijs.com/),
  [Yoga Layout](https://yogalayout.com/), [anime.js](https://animejs.com/),
  the support for [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and
  [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) is under construction.

:::caution
Although our customers have built quite a few content products using ap-core,
the API design has not yet reached the level of public availability. We are
trying to disassemble `@web-media/ap-core` into multiple smaller packages, to
reduce the complexity of the whole solution.
:::

- **Act Player:** `@web-media/act-player` is a React component which can render
  a lot of _assets_. [`EpisodeCore`](/API/core-manager/class/EpisodeCore)
  of [`@web-media/core-manager`](/api/core-manager) can take
  care of the task of lifecycle management and RAM management. The implementation
  of the core manager is "UI-frame neutral", it is useful if your team is not using
  [React](https://reactjs.org/) or want to build a different product based on
  the existing system. The interface of this player is full-customizable, you can
  pass your own implementation of every single component. Read the following
  articles for more details about how to customize it.

- **SDK:** `@web-media/client-sdk` is a React component for managing multiple
  episodes, client sdk will take care of data fetching and life cycle management,
  and interface customize. If you are building a product that has multiple
  episodes, SDK could be helpful. _SDK_ also supports interface customize, by
  building an interface component - an ESM module that exports a React hook -
  you can customize all possible behavior and visual experience with this
  feature without hacking the source code of _act player_.

- **Shell:** Shell is the environment your application or program running in, it
  could be a website, a desktop client, or a mobile application. There could be
  different kinds of platform-specific capabilities, like in-app purchases, resource
  cache, sharing, or deep-link. We're trying our best to build a set of official
  shell implementations for most use cases. For users without special requirements,
  we encourage you to use the official shell implementation, which is better
  integrated into _Web Media Foundation Studio_'s workflow. If you want to customize the
  capability of shells, please fork our official implementation. We will
  introduce how the Shell interacts with Web Media Foundation Studio in the following article.

:::tip
It's not necessary to fork the shell implementation if you only want to
customize the visual experience of the player, consider building a _"interface
component"_ can greatly improve the maintainability of the project.

## Use Cases

Web Media Foundation is a highly comprehensive system for interactive content management,
developers can implement various web applications with different levels of
architectures, here're some examples:

- **A naïve video player:** _Act player_ can be used as an independent video
  player with cross-browser consistent autoplay behavior and highly customizable
  API. Furthermore, if you want to build a web application with multiple videos,
  the multiple asset architecture would be useful if it belongs to single
  content and Client SDK can be used if they belong to multiple pages.

- **A naïve WebGL application:** If you want to build a simple web application
  for all major platforms, including mobile and desktop platforms, `ap-core` could
  be a handy tool since it handled a lot of possible performance and compatibility
  issues, especially for <span title="A web browser developed by Apple mainly for render apple.com correctly">Safari</span>.

- **A complex web application with mixed forms of content:** This is our main
  purpose of developing the Web Media Foundation, by using the whole solution you can
  get a series of simplified workflows from resource management, and preprocessing to
  project packaging and deployment.
