# TN8002: Client SDK - Series Level Media Playback

## Introduction

Client SDK is a set of React component and hooks which can help users building
their own third-party implemented client, this package will handle tasks related
to the loading of data files and customized interface module, and handle the
logic of the transition between different episodes.

We've officially implemented [three different shells](/docs/studio/st1001-assets-directory#template)
developers can checkout its source code and implement your own if there are more
advanced requirements.

## Usage

To build a new client shell, it's necessary build two React components: The root
component, and the player component.

:::caution
Please notice that all the data file are generated by the [Recative Studio](/docs/studio/intro),
we do not recommend developers manually write your own configuration since its
complexity, which could cause a lot of bugs.
:::

### The root component

The root component should wrap the player component with a configuration
context, which allows all the series level manage component could share them,
you can check the [detailed document of the API here](/api/client-sdk/interface/IPlayerSdkProviderProps).

### The player component

The player component should acquire a `Content` component from the
[`useContentComponent`](/api/client-sdk/function/useContentComponent) hook,
which will return a React component for later usage.

Developers need to wrap this component with the [`React.Suspense`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)
component to make sure it could response to the asynchronous logic properly.

The returned component have [several proprieties](/api/client-sdk/interface/IContentProps)
could be tuned for different purposes.

#### Router binding

If your application is managed by a router manager like [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main),
it's possible to bind the router to the episode ID of the player.

There are several tasks should be done:

1. Provide a [`episodeId`](/api/client-sdk/interface/IContentProps#episodeId)
   property to the `useContentComponent`.
2. Provide a [`onEpisodeIdUpdate`](/api/client-sdk/interface/IContentProps#onEpisodeIdUpdate)
   to handle the logic of the navigation related task.
3. Provide a [`gotoEpisode`](/api/definitions/interface/RawUserImplementedFunctions#gotoEpisode),
   [`gotoSeries`](/api/definitions/interface/RawUserImplementedFunctions#gotoSeries)
   function if your interactive program need related methods.

#### User related information

If your application contains logic related to login or avatar, nickname, please
put them in the `userData` property which can make sure it is type safe.

#### Build in resources

If the resource of your application is built in and do not need to be loaded
from the Internet, consider set the `preferredUploaders` and the
`trustedUploaders` property to boost the performance.

#### Platform specific dependencies

Native logics like data IO, which needs external dependencies, these tools need
to be specified by the `playerPropsHookDependencies` property. This value will
be passed to the [customized interface](/docs/technotes/tn7004-interface-components),
which can help developers building more advanced features.
