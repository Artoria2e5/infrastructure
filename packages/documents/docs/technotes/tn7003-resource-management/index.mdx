# TN7003: Resource Management

## Introduction

The resource management system of the Recative System provides:

- **Responsible resource loading mechanism:** Developers can let your
  application automatically pick up the resource by its language, platform like
  Windows or Android, and interaction methods, like touch screen or a mouse.

- **Resource loading:** We provide a series of methods to optimize how resource
  is loaded for the Web and mobile platforms, loading the resources in a priority
  queue to optimize the user experience of resource loading.

- **Resource conversion:** Including automatically create atlas images, format
  converting for the compatibility concerns.

- **Resource packing:** Creating multiple bundling profiles for different
  deployment purposes, for a example, you may want to create a web application
  and a mobile app at the same time, since all resources are published to
  different CDNs, you don't want to include them into the website again, but
  for the mobile application, you want to include all the resources into the
  package, since it would enable a better loading experience. With the resource
  packing feature, such requirements could be met.

## Architecture design

### Client side

The architecture of the resource loading process is constructed by:

- **`@recative/definition`:** The definition packages tells developers how the
  metadata of each resource file [is defined](/api/definitions/interface/IResourceFile),
  developers could write definition manually for each resource file, but it is
  not recommended, considering use Recative Studio to generate the definitions
  since it will provide a user friendly graphical interface for developers,
  while managing a large amount of files, Recative Studio is always more useful.

- **@recative/client-sdk`:** If you are using Recative Studio to generate your
  configurations,
