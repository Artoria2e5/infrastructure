# TN7003: Resource Management

## Introduction

The Reactive System's resource management system provides:

- **Responsive resource loading:** Developers can configure the application to
  automatically select resources based on language, platform (e.g. Windows or
  Android), and interaction methods (e.g. touch screen or mouse).

- **Optimized resource loading:** We offer methods for optimizing resource
  loading on web and mobile platforms, using a priority queue to enhance the
  user experience.

- **Resource conversion:** Automatically create atlas images and convert formats
  for compatibility.

- **Resource bundling:** Create multiple profiles for different deployment
  needs. For example, when creating a web and mobile app simultaneously,
  resources can be published to different CDNs. The website may not require all
  resources, but the mobile app may benefit from having all resources bundled in
  the package for better loading performance.

## Client side resource management

### Data flow

- **`@recative/definition`:** This package defines the metadata for each
  resource file. Developers can manually write definitions for each file, but it
  is recommended to use Recative Studio to generate them for a more
  user-friendly interface and ease of management for larger sets of files.

- **`@recative/client-sdk`:** If using Recative Studio to generate
  configurations, this package can utilize the output and handle data fetching
  and decoding tasks.

- **`@recative/act-player`:** If using `@recative/client-sdk`, the player is
  automatically created. Alternatively, developers can manually pass resource
  definitions to the player, which acts as a conduit to the
  `@recative/core-manager` for resource management.

- **`@recative/core-manager`:** This layer is responsible for managing the
  selection of resources.

### Resource selection

If the developer required a resource group, like a texture. The resource will be
selected with a weighted score. Recative System will pick the resource with the
maximum score as the result resource file.

Such tasks is finished by the [`@recative/smart-resource`](/api/smart-resource/function/calculateResourceScore)

There are three necessary elements for the resource selection task:

- **Selector:** A string with colon, the string before the colon is the group
  name and the string after the colon is the value, here is an example:

  ```
  category:image
  ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~
  Group    Value
  ```

- **Environmental variable configurations: ** This is the detailed config of
  users' devices. If you are using the API provided by `@recative/core-manager`,
  these variables would be specified by the [`EnvVariableManager`](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/a391b0dfbc42a8ccffcec6404dc3e86bb019f12f/packages/core-manager/src/manager/envVariable/EnvVariableManager.ts)
  with the following keys:

  - **`lang`:** The language of users' devices.

  - **`device`:** The input device is a mouse or a touch screen.

  - **`screen`:** The screen size is [small, medium or large](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/a391b0dfbc42a8ccffcec6404dc3e86bb019f12f/packages/core-manager/src/manager/envVariable/utils/screenSize.ts#L1).

## Configuration Generation

If developers decide to manage their resource files with the Recative Studio,
the configuration will be managed automatically. By importing the resource will
be processed by various extensions:

- **`@recative/extension-av`:** Splits audio and video files into different
  channels for the video playback system provided by the Recative System. This
  improves consistency across all major platforms. The audio file will be
  converted to fix any possible compatibility issues.
- **`@recative/atlas`:** Analyzes the dimensions of textures and packs them into
  an atlas texture to save memory and improve the stability of the application
  on mobile platforms.
- **`@recative/extension-audio-backends`:** Provides options on the interface
  that guide the audio system to play audio files in a streamed way even when
  using the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
- **`@recative/extension-crowdin`: ** Provides scripts for synchronizing
  translation files from the Crowdin platform. These files can be used for
  internationalization purposes.

:::info
Although there is currently no way for users of the Recative Studio to add
third-party extensions, developers can create a pull request to the code
repository and discuss their desired extension with the Recative team.

This way, the team can review the proposed solution and potentially implement
it in the future.

## API Usage

### Video

The official implementation of the Video component in the Recative Studio
requires that the audio and video channels be split into two separate files. The
category tag must be set to video and audio, respectively, for each file. This
means that the group must contain two files, one with the `category:audio` tag
and the other with the `category:video` tag in its [`tags`](/api/definitions/interface/IResourceFile#tags)
field. This is to ensure that the correct files are used for the video and audio
channels during playback.

### Interactive program

For developers who is developing your program with `PIXI.js`, here is a
component provided by the `@recative/ap-core`, here is an example:

```ts
import { SmartSprite } from '@recative/ap-core';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const nameSprite = new SmartSprite({ label: YOUR_RESOURCE_LABEL });

  nameSprite.anchor.set(0.5);
  nameSprite.position.set(1082, 174 + i * 80);

  // It is a general PIXI component, so you can add it to some container.
  // someContainer.addChild(nameSprite);
};
```

### Develop your own interface component

The `ResourceManager` provided by the `episodeCore` contains methods for
developers to manually selecting resources from the episode configuration,
here are the example:

```ts
const matchedResource = props.core
  .getEpisodeData()
  ?.episodeData.resources.getResourceByQuery(
    YOUR_RESOURCE_LABEL,
    'label',
    {
      category: 'subtitle',
      lang: 'en',
    },
    {
      category: 1e4,
      lang: 1,
    }
  );
```
