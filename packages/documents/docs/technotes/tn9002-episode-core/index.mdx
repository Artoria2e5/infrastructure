# TN9002: Episode Core - Episode Level Content Management

## Abstract

**Act Player** and **Episode Core** are the core component to manage multiple
contents that creator made. In this article, we will introduce the anatomy of
these parts and give a brief guide about how customizing your player for both
visual experience and functions which can fit your very own requirement.

## Episode Core

Episode Core is the fundamental part which can manage all content segments
provided by creators, it will manage the following tasks:

- **Lifecycle Management:** To ensure contents loads smoothly and does not crash
  due to memory spikes, we need a well-established lifecycle mechanism to schedule
  the preloading, loading and destroy task of each part of your content, we will
  how lifecycle works later.

- **Time synchronize and schedule:**
  [Synchronizing multiple media source](https://github.com/Web-Media-Foundation/infrastructure/blob/05a199e188eecf9b10cbb0225a478463d0a878d7/packages/time-schedule/src/timeline.ts) like
  video channel and audio channel.
  [triggering events](https://github.com/Web-Media-Foundation/infrastructure/blob/05a199e188eecf9b10cbb0225a478463d0a878d7/packages/definitions/src/utils/managedCoreState.ts#L183)
  for various purpose like displaying subtitles, showing additional tips at
  specific time point of the video, switching BGM at different time, etc.

- **Audio playback management:** To make sure Autoplay related functions can
  work correctly, we built a time system which can manage all tasks related to
  audio playback with the
  [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
  This can help us play any audio files after users triggered their first
  interaction with the page on any browser.

:::info
For video files, we split the file into two different parts: a video file and
an audio files. There is an extension can handle this task in _Web Media Foundation Studio_,
after the file is imported, channel splitting, compatibility fixing and many
other tasks can be finished automatically.
:::

- **Resource management:** Core Manager will manage all files imported to
  _Web Media Foundation Studio_ (like audio, video, subtitle files or texture files). It will
  preload necessary resources, automatically select different resource for
  different language and platform, select resource from multiple CDN and storage
  source (which make offline storage possible).

- **Task queue:** Since JavaScript is a single-threaded language, we must design
  a scheduling mechanism to ensure that a large number of background tasks will
  not affect the rendering performance. _Core Manager_ provides priority queues:
  the fast queue and the slow queue. You can arrange tasks into different queues
  according to the priority of the tasks. _Core Manager_ will arrange the tasks
  without affecting rendering performance.

### `Content` and `ContentInstance`

`Content` is the specification (or definition, configuration) of an
[asset](/docs/technotes/tn9001-project-model#asset), and `ContentInstance` is
the class did the actual content management related work, like resources, and
lifecycle:

- `Timeline`: which manage the time of different tracks when the timing of
  different tracks is out of sync, the `Timeline` coordinates the different
  tracks according to priority configuration.
- `AudioTrack`: Plays the audio track of a video.
- `AudioHost`: Plays sound effects of the assets.
- `SubsequenceManager`: Allows the asset to create and control
  [subsequences](#subsequence).
- `managedCoreStateList`: Manages subtitles and other states of the content.

The `ContentInstance` also keeps references to some global resources, like the
`TaskQueue`, which schedules async tasks.

### Lifecycle

The `ContentInstance` has five different states:

- `idle`: The `ContentInstance` is created, but the user interface is not loaded
  yet.
- `preloading`: The `ContentInstance` is created but the required resources are
  still loading.
- `ready`: The `ContentInstance` is ready to be shown on the stage.
- `destroying`: The `ContentInstance` is destroying itself.
- `destroyed`: The `ContentInstance` is destroyed, all the resources
  it used to be released.

`ContentInstance` also can be manually set to `shown` or `hidden`. However,
the loading indicator but not the `ContentInstance` should not be shown to the
user when its state is not ready.

### `Sequence` and <span id="subsequence">Subsequence</span>

The `Sequence`(segments, assets) is a series of Content. It controls the creation,
destruction, showing and hiding of each asset, switching between different
assets, time calculation and Synchronization.

### Time calculation

Each asset in the Sequence has a duration. The value could be infinite if
necessary (like interact point).

To calculate current time of the sequence, we add up all the finite duration of
played asset, and add the time from the `Timeline` of the current segment if
the duration is finite.

To seek a specific time in the sequence, we find the segment that the time falls
in, and calculate the time in that asset.

### Switching between assets

To start the internal process of asset switching, we:

1. set the `nextSegment` to the order of the next asset.
2. set the `nextSegmentStartTime` to the start time of next Content after switching.
3. then call the internal `switchToNextContent` method.

The `switchToNextContent` method will get the blocker of this asset switching.
and wait for the blocker to unblock new asset setup.

When there are nothing blocking the loading process, it will destroy the old
asset if the old asset has the `earlyDestroyOnSwitch` property, and create
the new asset.

After new asset created, we will wait for:

- The ready state of the new asset.
- The blocker to unblock final Switching.
- Dependencies of the asset to complete.

Then, we will show the new asset, destroy the old asset if it's not destroyed,
then set the time and playing state on the new asset.

If the next asset does not have a `preloadDisabled` property, it will be
preloaded now.

It is possible to switch from or switch to `undefined` content. When the
sequence switches to `undefined` content, it will fire an `end` event.

### Subsequence

<SequenceStructure
  style={{
    maxWidth: '200px',
    padding: '0 16px',
    float: 'right',
  }}
  alt="The three-level model of the Web Media Foundation"
/>

Assets can create their own subsequences. `subsequence`s are like the main
sequence, but some behaviors are managed by the parent sequence:

- The subsequence will be hidden if its parent content is hidden.
- The subsequence will not play if its parent content is not playing.
- The subsequence should also be destroyed when its parent content is destroyed.
