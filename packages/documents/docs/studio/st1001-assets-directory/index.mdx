# Asset Files

Asset files are necessary parts to build up an application bundle, if users
would like build an application with the Recative System, users need to prepare
the following files:

| File Type   | Glob Pattern                        | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constants   | `constant-*.json`                   | A JSON file used to determin the variation of you package.                                   |
| Template    | `template.*`                        | A ZIP file template, bundling extensions will inject necessary files and build your package. |
| Web Root    | `*-web-root.zip`                    | A Web root file, which contains the HTML file and CSS file of the website.                   |
| Custom Skin | `components/containerComponents.js` | A React component file which can alter the apperance of the interactive video player.        |

## Constants

Constants is a global variable description file that could be read by both 
interactive programs and players, you can access the content via
`window.constant`, Recative System require that all the modules **must** be
loaded **after** the constants to be available, so developers can make the
assumption that the variable is always available.

Here are some critical keys that will affect the behavior of the Recative
System:

* `clientType`: This will make the smart resource matcher to give priority to
  specific files with the `client:*` tag;
* `localStorage`: An `Object`, the key is the `localStorage` key, and the value
  is the `localStorage` value, this value will be rewited each time when the
  application launched.

## Template

Platform specific logic should be located in the application template, for the
mobile application, it could be a Ionic or React Native application without all
the HTML files, for desktop application template, it could be a Electron or
Tauri application bundle, we will use this file as a base for your applcation.

Here is a list for all official implemented templates (and we call it shells):
* **[Mobile Shell](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/tree/master/packages/mobile-shell):** For Android and iOS application;
* **[Desktop Shell](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/tree/master/packages/desktop-shell):** Shells for the Windows and macOS programs;
* **[Web Shell](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/tree/master/packages/web-shell):** For web applications.

## Web Root

A zip contains all the files related to the application, but without the
resource files and the compiled code bundle, an identical web root file contains
all the files generated by the `Create React App` tool.

## Custom Skin

If you want to customize the apperance of the player but do not want to modify
the source code of the [`act-player`](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/tree/master/packages/act-player)
You can build a customized skin, which is a React module injected by the [`@paciolan/remote-module-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paciolan/remote-module-loader)

This module should export three different variables:
* **`usePlayerProps`:** A react hook which will return variables that inject
  properies to the `client-sdk` and `act-player`.
* **`Container`:** The container which wrap the player, which you can implement
  more advanced design.
* **`interfaceComponents`:** Interface Components which developers could add
  features to the player.

Here are the [detailed typing description](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/94572bda8a1e6bb8f71cb51b7456587186ca99d4/packages/client-sdk/src/components/Content.tsx#L89-L96)
of the injected module, you can check it as a reference to implement your own
customization. And here are the injected parameters of the [container component](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/94572bda8a1e6bb8f71cb51b7456587186ca99d4/packages/client-sdk/src/components/Content.tsx#L289-L317).
