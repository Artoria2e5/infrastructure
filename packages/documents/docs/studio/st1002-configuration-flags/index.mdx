# ST1002: Mobile shell overrides for debug purpose

## Introduction
This document lists all possible configurations for debug purposes. You can set
these values via debugger in `localstorage`, and reload the app to make them
take effect.

All overrides are named in a path-like style, the second part of the path
represents the configuration is coded in which package.

## Configurations
Here is a list of the supported flags:

* **`@recative/mobile-shell/path`:** Override the path of data source, this is
  useful if you want the application load configuration from LAN, to preview
  changes on mobile application.

* **`@recative/mobile-shell/data-type`:** Use which type of data, JSON or BSON.
  BSON is a more efficient encoding format. Changing this is not necessary in
  most cases.

* **`@recative/mobile-shell/console`:** Enable `vConsole` or not, if you don't
  have an expensive macOS machine, and want to debug problems on mobile platform,
  this would be useful.

* **`@recative/mobile-shell/index-order`:** Change the episode order of the
  first episode. If this override is available, the app would find the episode
  with this order number, and show it instead the episode with the order of 0.

* **`@recative/mobile-shell/preferred-uploaders`:** Override the uploader
  configuration. This is useful while the media package is not published and
  developers want to see changes immediately.

* **`@recative/client-sdk/container-component`:** Override the remote component
  path, this would be useful if developers is debugging a skin for mobile
  platform.

* **`@recative/smart-resource/report-match-score`:** Generate a report of each
  smart resource matching request, to debug i18n related problems.

* **`@recative/core-manager/report-resource-validation`:** Generate a report of
  each smart resource URL trying request, to debug CDN related problems.

* **`@recative/ap-pack/no-sw`:** Disable Service Worker to make the act point
  work like an application.

* **`@recative/ap-pack/debug-lifecycle`:** Show an overlay about the lifecycle
  and status of the act-point, red means script not loaded, orange means script
  loaded but act point not played, green means the act point is played by the
  player, purple means the act point is paused by the player.

* **`@recative/demo-player/bundle-id`:** A number, to fetch metadata for
  specific version of the project.

## Usage example

Here is a code snippest for you to see how configuration flag wors:

```ts
localStorage['@recative/mobile-shell/path'] = 'https://developer.nicestick.io:9999/bson/$fileName'
localStorage['@recative/mobile-shell/data-type'] = 'bson';
localStorage["@recative/mobile-shell/preferred-uploaders"] = [
    "@recative/uploader-extension-mobile-shell/cached",
    "@recative/uploader-extension-mobile-shell/build-in",
    "@recative/uploader-extension-s3-oss/S3Uploader",
    "@recative/uploader-extension-ali-oss/AliOSSUploader",
    "@recative/uploader-polyv-vod/PolyVUploader",
    "@recative/uploader-extension-studio/ResourceManager"
  ].join();
localStorage.debug = '*';
```

Please be caution that the `localStorage` field of the `constant` configuration
will alway override your configuration each time the program starts. If some
bugs happened, check the `window.constant` variable to investigate the detail.
